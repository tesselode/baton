Baton
-----
**Baton** is an input library for LÖVE that bridges the gap between keyboard and gamepad controls and allows you to easily define and change controls on the fly.

```lua
local baton = require 'baton'

local controls = {
  left = {'key:left', 'axis:leftx-', 'button:dpleft'},
  right = {'key:right', 'axis:leftx+', 'button:dpright'},
  up = {'key:up', 'axis:lefty-', 'button:dpup'},
  down = {'key:down', 'axis:lefty+', 'button:dpdown'},
  movement = {'axispair:up,down,left,right'},
  shoot = {'key:x', 'button:a'}
}

local input = baton.new(controls, love.joystick.getJoysticks()[1])

function love.update(dt)
  input:update()

  local horizontal, vertical = input:get 'movement'
  playerShip:move(horizontal, vertical)

  if input:pressed 'shoot' then
    playerShip:shoot()
  end
end
```

Installation
============
To use Baton, place `baton.lua` in your project, and then add this code to your `main.lua`:
```lua
baton = require 'baton' -- if your baton.lua is in the root directory
baton = require 'path.to.baton' -- if it's in subfolders
```

Usage
=====
### Defining controls
Controls are defined using a table. Each key should be the name of a control, and each value should be another table. This table contains strings defining what inputs should be mapped to the control. For example, this table
```lua
controls = {
  left = {'key:left', 'axis:leftx-'}
  shoot = {'key:x', 'button:a'}
}
```
will create a control called "left" that responds to the left arrow key and pushing the left analog stick on the controller to the left, and a control called "shoot" that responds to the X key on the keyboard and the A button on the gamepad.

Inputs are strings with the following format:
```lua
'[input type]:[input source]'
```
Here are the different input types and the sources that can be associated with them:

| Type    | Description                  | Source                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------| -----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`   | A keyboard key.              | Any LÖVE [KeyConstant](http://love2d.org/wiki/KeyConstant)                                                                                                              |
| `sc`    | A scancode.                  | Any LÖVE [KeyConstant](http://love2d.org/wiki/KeyConstant)                                                                                                              |
| `mouse` | A mouse button.              | A number representing a mouse button (see [love.mouse.isDown](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.mouse.isDown))                                                               |
| `axis`  | A joystick or gamepad axis.  | Either a number representing a joystick axis or a LÖVE [GamepadAxis](http://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadAxis). Add a '+' or '-' on the end to denote the direction to detect.|
| `button`| A joystick or gamepad button.| Either a number repesenting a joystick button or a LÖVE [GamepadButton](http://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadButton)                                                           |

### Players
**Players** are the objects that monitor and manage inputs.

#### Creating players
To create a player, use `baton.new`:
```lua
player = baton.new(controls, joystick)
```
`controls` is a table of controls, and `joystick` is a LÖVE joystick (returned from `love.joystick.getJoysticks`). The `joystick` argument is optional; if it's not specified, or if the joystick becomes unavailable later, the player object will just ignore controller inputs.

#### Updating players
You should update each player each frame by calling this function:
```lua
player:update()
```

#### Getting the value of controls
To get the value of an input, use:
```lua
value = player:get(control)
```
For example, for the controls defined above, we could get the value of the "left" control by doing
```lua
left = player:get 'left'
```
`player:get` always returns a number between 0 and 1, and as such, it is most applicable to controls that act as axes, such as movement controls. To get the value of a control without applying the deadzone, use `player:getRaw`.

#### Getting down, pressed, and released states
To see whether a control is currently "held down", use:
```lua
down = player:down(control)
```
`player:down` returns `true` if the values of the control is greater than the deadzone, and `false` if not.

```lua
pressed = player:pressed(control)
```
`player:pressed` return `true` if the control was pressed this `frame`, and false if not.

```lua
released = player:released(control)
```
`player:released` return `true` if the control was released this `frame`, and false if not.

These functions are most applicable for controls that act as buttons, such as a shoot button. That being said, they can be used for any control, which is useful if you want to, for example, use a movement control as a discrete button press to operate a menu.

#### Changing controls and deadzone
At any time, you can change the controls for a player by calling:
```lua
player:changeControls(controls)
```
Just pass in a new table of controls, and the player will seamlessly update to use the new controls.

You can also change the deadzone of the player by setting `player.deadzone` to a number between `0` and `1`. The deadzone is set to `0.5` by default.

If you need to access or change the joystick associated with a player, use `player.joystick` (which is just a standard LÖVE [Joystick](https://love2d.org/wiki/Joystick) object).

#### Getting the active input device
At any time, only the keyboard/mouse sources or the gamepad sources will be active. A device will be considered active if any of the sources for that device exceed the deadzone. The keyboard and mouse will always take precedence over the gamepad.

You can call `player:getActiveDevice()` to see which input device is currently active. It will either be `'keyboard'` or `'joystick'` (or `nil` if no inputs have been used yet). This is useful if you need to change what you display on screen based on the controls the player is using (such as instructions).

*Note:* mouse sources are counted under `keyboard`.
